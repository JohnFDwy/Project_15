# Facial Recognition Project

## Description

Employ Machine Learning models to accurately predict the ages of men and women based solely on their headshots

## Conclusion 

Based on our results from GPU, we can make some conclusions about our models:

The model's MAE on the validation set drops below 8 and continues to drop with each epoch added in this case which suggests that the model is learning to make predictions effectively.

The training set's MAE and the validation's set's MAE are different by a significant degree, this suggests that there may be overfitting.

The results suggest that computer vision can accurately predict ages of our photos to an acceptable degree.
